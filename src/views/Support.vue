          <p>In the past, our support has been primarily volunteer based ranging from our leadership, to our researchers, to our in-kind partnerships
              of the hospitals and medical centers. We are very grateful, and at the same time we are looking forward to transitioning and building our
              self-sustaining non-profit research organization.<br> <br>
              
              An ever increasing percentage of the population visits an emergency department each year. Additionally, the economic pressures
              associated with health care and health care education are increasing. If we do not train more health care professionals, the quality
              of healthcare will deteriorate as emergency department visits continue to increase. <br> <br>
              
              More than half of the U.S. population visits an emergency department as a patient or visitor annually. The average emergency
              department visit is four hours. If the hospital uses a standard cost accounting system, this cost could be anywhere from $500 to
              $1000 an hour, depending on the length of the visit. Our Research Associates can help keep those emergency department costs down by
              gathering necessary information that is often missed. The cost of providing our Research Associates is around $50 per hour. This is
              cost-free to both the hospital and the patient. <br> <br>
              
              We are now in a position to receive funding from various sources such as grants, endowments, legacies, and private and individual
              contributions, to help our Research Associates. Our goal is to make NARAP a self-sufficient organization capable of supporting our
              volunteers in their quest to further their health care education! <br> <br>
